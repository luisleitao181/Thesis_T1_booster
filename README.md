# Master Thesis – Booster T1 Localisation

Author: Luís Leitão  
Platform: Booster T1 (ROS2-based humanoid)

## Overview

This repository contains all development work for my Master's Thesis, structured in three main components:

1. Localisation (Extended Kalman Filter – MATLAB analysis)
2. Perception (YOLO-based environment feature detection)
3. Simulation (Isaac Sim – future work)

## Repository Structure

### /localisation
Contains MATLAB-based EKF simulations and experimental analysis used for the related article.

### /yolo_training
Contains scripts, dataset processing tools, and model documentation for YOLO-based perception.

### /isaacsim
Reserved for future simulation work using NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

## Reproducibility Note

Large datasets, trained model weights, and recordings are not stored in this repository.
This repository contains only source code and experiment metadata.
